# DontPanic.JAR
A recreation of the 1986 Infocom Game "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" To Teach Myself Java

## What are you doing?

Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The books, the radio programs and the BCC series defined my childhood, and I struggled like hell through the Infocom game as well. My plan to teach myself GUIs, user inputs and advanced logic in Java is to rebuild this game with the game's original script in its own standalone Java version.

### What still needs to be done?

Everything!
* How should logic work with player choice?
* How should inventory work?
     I'm thinking something along the lines of a matrix where certain inventory slots are assigned a binary value.
* More questions!

### What have I done so far?
* Uh, I made my first window in Java.
